Get an API Key 
First, generate an API key specifically for Google AI services. 
Go to the Google AI Studio website (aistudio.google.com).
Make sure to log into your Google account.
Click Create API key and select an existing or new Google Cloud project.
The key will be generated and displayed. Copy it immediately, as it may not be viewable again. 
2. Secure the Key
For security, do not embed the raw API key directly into the application's source code. This exposes it to users and version control systems. 
Server-Side Apps: Store the key as an environment variable on the server and access it programmatically.
Client-Side (Web/Mobile) Apps: Use a backend proxy server to make calls to the Gemini API, keeping the key hidden on the server, or use an authentication method like Firebase Authentication with a backend.
API Restrictions: Add restrictions to the API key in the Google Cloud Console to limit which IP addresses or apps can use it, which reduces unauthorized use. 
3. Choose a Client Library
Google provides official client libraries for interacting with the Gemini API. Choose the library that matches your development environment: 
Python: google-genai
Node.js: @google/genai
Java: google-genai
Go: google-genai
Android: google-genai
Dart/Flutter: google-genai 
Install the appropriate SDK using your project's package manager (e.g., pip install google-genai for Python or npm install @google/genai for Node.js). 
4. Implement the Integration
The core integration involves initializing the client library with the API key and making requests. 
A. Initialize the Client
Access your API key securely (e.g., from an environment variable) and initialize the client: 
python
# Python example accessing the key from environment variables
import os
from google import genai

# The library automatically looks for a GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable
client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY"))
Use code with caution.

B. Generate Content
Use the client object to send prompts to the Gemini model and process the response: 
python
# Python example of generating text
prompt = "Explain how black holes work."
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model='gemini-2.5-flash',
    contents=prompt
)

print(response.text)
Use code with caution.
